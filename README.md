# CDIO-Klondike

This project is in two parts, a part in python which is the object_detection, and a part in java which is the SolitairClient.

Furthermore there is a folder for the compiled output of both parth which are placed in the folder "Compiled Versions" and in that folder there is a seperate README for what is required in order to run the compiled versions. 

The weights file mentioned in the readme in the compiled folder can be downloaded from this google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1koa8gMwmB1a70rJUdvf8bmsWkux0r8WB?usp=sharing and is the file "yolov3_training_last.weights" and has to be downloaded and placed in the compiled version folder if that is wished to be run, or in the source folder for the Object_detection if it is wished to run the object detection from scource.
